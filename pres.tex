    \frametitle{History and Design Philosophy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed by Bram Moolenaar, initially released in 1991.
        \item Successor to \texttt{vi} (\textbf{v}isual \textbf{i}nterface for line editor \texttt{ex}).
        \item Editing works entirely over keyboard, most commands are easily reachable over home row.
        \item Plugins (written in \texttt{VimScript}) \textit{can} provide functionality similar to an IDE.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{But why?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It's everywhere (if you want it) --- a lot of software has the option of using \texttt{vim} keybindings.
        \begin{description}
            \item [\texttt{qutebrowser}]  webbrowser
            \item [\texttt{vifm}]         filemanager
            \item [\texttt{IdeaVim}]      \texttt{vim} keybindings for JetBrains IDEs
            \item [\texttt{ExcelLikeVim}] \texttt{vim} keybindings for MS Excel (yes, seriously)
        \end{description}
        \item It's versatile --- lightweight text editor or almost-universal IDE (or anything in between).
        \item It's ``intuitive'' --- after getting used to it, you can use \texttt{vim} almost like a language.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Basics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modes

                \item [\texttt{COMMAND}] open, close, or save a file
                \item [\texttt{INSERT}]  direct input (i.\ e.\ actually typing text)
                \item [\texttt{VISUAL}]  text highlighting, text blocking
            \end{description}
